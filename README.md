## 🌄 Who are we?
**Bisontech** is a student organization made from students by students. Our mission is to develop the tech abilities of every student of our community, regardless their major.

**Bisontech** is the perfect place for anyone who wants to learn some technology, build a project with the community, even share their knowledge with the community and have a good time.
